## EX 10 : IMPLEMENTATION OF DIFFIE HELLMAN ALGORITHM

## AIM :
To implement key exchange between users using Diffie Hellman algorithm.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Select a large prime number P and a primitive root G of P (publicly known).
2.	Alice selects a private key a and computes her public key x = (G^a) mod P.
3.	Bob selects a private key b and computes his public key y = (G^b) mod P.
4.	Alice and Bob exchange their public keys (x and y).
5.	Alice computes the secret key as ka = (y^a) mod P.
6.	Bob computes the secret key as kb = (x^b) mod P.
7.	Both ka and kb will be the same, forming a shared secret key for secure communication.
